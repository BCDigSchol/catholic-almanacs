    <figcaption>Our map in progress, showing our preliminary data from the 1870 almanac.  Each dot represents one Catholic institution in the US (though some dots are stacked atop one another in urban areas)&#8212;usually a church, school hospital, orphanage, asylum, et al.  The different colors are not a key; rather, they represent different dioceseses that contain the institutions and are marked as distinct colors so one can see the geographic borders of each diocese.</figcaption>
