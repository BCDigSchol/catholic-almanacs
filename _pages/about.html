<h3>The Project</h3>

<p>The project transforms a dense list of institution names, places, and people featured in nineteenth-century Catholic almanacs into a social history users can see.  Our current centerpiece is a map of all the institutions and how they change over time as new churches form and the boundaries of dioceses expand.  We also want users to be able to search for individuals and institutions to see what the almanacs say about them, and eventually to connect to other existing data about those people and organizations. </p>


<h3>The Original Data Creation Process</h3>

<p>In the Spring and Summer of 2024, a team of outstanding BC humanities students under the direction of Ashlyn Stewart and funded by the Libraries Catholic Collections Initiative undertook the crucial and unglamorous transcribing and encoding work required to launch the project.  The students tagged (and, thus, structured) each institutionâ€™s name, place, and affiliates for the 1870 almanac in XML format.  We then transformed the XML data into a .csv format to power our visualizations more easily.  All of our data will soon be available in our GitHub repository as a series of spreadsheets.  Some of our most important data encoding and structuring decisions are described on our Data Details Page.</p>
