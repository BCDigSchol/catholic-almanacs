<h2>Project Summary</h2>
<p>The project transforms a dense list of institution names, places, and people featured in nineteenth-century Catholic almanacs into a social history users can see.  By digitizing and structuring the data found in these printed almanacs, users will be able both to see a macro view of Catholic institutions in the nineteenth century and dig into specific details about any given institution.  Our current centerpiece is a map of all the institutions and how they change over time as new churches form and the boundaries of dioceses expand.  Using our database, users can search for individuals and institutions to see what the almanacs say about them; eventually, we will also have those records to connect to other existing data about those people and organizations. </p>

<h2>Data Summary</h2>
<h3>Information about our Data Source</h3>
<p>[Add a brief description about the almanacs and link to <a href="almanacdetails.html">Almanac Details Page</a></p>
<p>For a list of where each almanac is available digitally, see <a target="_blank" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1IU1z0HL9ReQDMbPcQE1sGFDlyfqu7fJYhQXh7-nbA9Y/edit?usp=sharing">our spreadsheet.</a></p>

<h3>The Original Data Creation Process</h3>
<p>In the Spring and Summer of 2024, a team of outstanding BC humanities students under the direction of Ashlyn Stewart and funded by the Libraries Catholic Collections Initiative undertook the crucial and unglamorous transcribing and encoding work required to launch the project.  The students tagged (and, thus, structured) each institution’s name, place, and affiliates for the 1870 almanac in XML format.  We then transformed the XML data into a .csv format to power our visualizations more easily.  Some of our most important data encoding and structuring decisions are described on our <a href="datadetails.html">Data Details Page</a>.</p>

<h3>Continuing Data Creation</h3>
<p>Students are now working backwards in time, extracting each institution’s name, place, and affiliates for almanacs ranging from 1864-69.  Students compare the 1869 Almanac against our 1870 data, identifying places it has changed to create the 1869 dataset without having to encode from wholecloth.  If there is no change year over year, the students are able to pretty quickly fill in a diocese's information based on the following year.  However, if there are changes (which often happens with an individual's name or sometimes a place name), encoding the data takes a bit longer.  The process will continue year by year until the 1830s.  Then, the team will return to 1871 and move forward in the same fashion through 1895.</p>
<p>Our team adds new data about different dioceses in different years every day!  If you don't see a diocese you're curious about, drop us a line [ADD LINK HERE]; we can give you an estimate of when it will be ready.</p>
  
<h3>Accessing our Data</h3>
<p>You can search for specific institutions and individuals in our current dataset using our database [ADD LINK HERE].  All of our data will also soon be available in our GitHub repository as a series of spreadsheets.</p>
