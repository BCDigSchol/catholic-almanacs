<h3>The Project</h3>

<p>As part of BC Libraries Catholic Collections Initiative, the Digital Scholarship Group is making Catholic almanac data from the 19th century United States more widely available and searchable. Each almanac includes a list of all the institutions in each of the country’s dioceses–every elementary and secondary school; every university and college; and every hospital, orphanage, and asylum that was under a diocese’s supervision. Rather than telling the story of the predominately white, male Catholic leadership only, these almanacs record a bottom-up social history of Catholic people and organizations of all stripes in the 19th century United States.</p>
<p>The project transforms this dense list of institution names, places, and people into a story users can see.  Our current centerpiece is a map of all the institutions and how they change over time as new churches form and the boundaries of dioceses expand.  We also want users to be able to search for individuals and institutions to see what the almanacs say about them, and eventually to connect to other existing data about those people and organizations. </p>


<h3>The Original Data Creation Process</h3>

<p>In the Spring and Summer of 2024, a team of outstanding BC humanities students under the direction of Ashlyn Stewart undertook the crucial and unglamorous transcribing and encoding work required to launch the project. Using an encoding language called XML, the students tagged (and, thus, structured) each institution’s name, place, and affiliates for the 1870 almanac.  We then transformed the data into a .csv format to power our visualizations more easily.  Some of our most important data encoding and structuring decisions are described below.</p>

<h4>Institutions We Encoded</h4>

<p></p>

<h4>Institution Names</h4>

<p></p>

<h4>Encoding Locations</h4>

<p>We derived addresses from information given in the almanac; sometimes that included detailed information like cross-streets, and sometimes that was simply a town name.  We then used Awesome Geocoder to create coordinates based on those addresses.  When no coordinates could be generated--usually because the town is defunct--our team did additional research to find the coordinates of the institution.  To that end, the level of precision in locations identified varies by region, especially when a town is defunct.  Sometimes we could find a historical marker with exact coordinates of a location, and other times we had to create a somewhat arbitrary point nearby a named creek, for example.  When we did research, we also included links to the information sources we used to find the information.  In the future, we hope to create a process where those who are more knowledgeable about specific regions can send us updated location information to make our data as accurate as possible.</p>

<h4>Encoding Individuals</h4>

<p>We attempt to give every individual named in the almanac a unique ID so that we can trace that individual's journey, perhaps through different churches and dioceses, over time.  However, our job is complicated by the fact that many individuals appear more than once in the almanac, such as when an urban priest also vists or attends a nearby rural church that does not have its own dedicated priest.  For now, if individuals have the exact same name and are in the same diocese, they are given the same ID.  Those individuals might be disambiguated (two John Smiths, for example) and given separe IDs with additional historical research.  Similarly, if two individuals have even slightly different names, they are given different IDs.  Some individuals might become associated (J. Smith in downtown Cincinnati and John Smith in the Cincinnati suburbs, for example) and assigned the same ID with additional historical research.</p>

<h3>Project Next steps</h3>

<p>After completing the 1870 almanac, we are moving back in time year by year to trace how the Catholic Church developed over time.  Students will compare the 1869 Almanac against our 1870 data, identifying places it has changed to create the 1869 dataset without having to encode from wholecloth.  The process will continue year by year until the 1830s.  Then the team will return to 1871 and move forward in the same fashion through 1895.</p>
