  <p>What did Catholicism look like in the nineteenth-century United States?  Where did Catholics live, and what sorts of institutions did they build, use, and serve?  We provide data to answer these questions and more by making publicly available information included in Catholic almanacs dating from 1834-1895.</p>  
  <p>Each almanac includes a list of all the Catholic institutions in each of the country's dioceses from that year&#8212;every elementary and secondary school; every university and college; and every hospital, orphanage, and asylum; and more.  We generally know the institution's name, location, and leaders, allowing us to answer the "who, what, when, and where" of Catholics and Catholicism in this era at a micro and macro scale.</p>  
  <p>By sharing and visualizing the almanacs' data, we hope to allow scholars and novices alike to trace the development of Catholicism across the United States and across the nineteenth-century.</p>

    <figcaption>Our map in progress, showing our preliminary data from the 1870 almanac.  Each dot represents one Catholic institution in the US (though some dots are stacked atop one another in urban areas)&#8212;usually a church, school hospital, orphanage, asylum, et al.  The different colors are not a key; rather, they represent different dioceseses that contain the institutions and are marked as distinct colors so one can see the geographic borders of each diocese.</figcaption>
