  <p>As part of BC Libraries Catholic Collections Initiative, the Digital Scholarship Group is making Catholic almanac data from the 19th century United States more widely available and searchable. Each almanac includes a list of all the institutions in each fo the country's diocese-every elementary and secondary school; every university and college; and every hospital, orphanage, and asylum that was under a diocese's supervision.</p>
