      As part of the BC Libraries Catholic Collections Initiative, the Digital Scholarship Group is making Catholic almanac data from the nineteenth-century United States more widely available and searchable. Each almanac includes a list of all the institutions in each of the country's dioceses - every elementary and secondary school; every university and college; and every hospital, orphanage, and asylum that was under a diocese's supervision.
