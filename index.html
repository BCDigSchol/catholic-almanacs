  <p>As part of BC Libraries Catholic Collections Initiative, the Digital Scholarship Group is making Catholic almanac data from the 19th century United States more widely available and searchable. Each almanac includes a list of all the institutions in each fo the country's diocese&#8212;every elementary and secondary school; every university and college; and every hospital, orphanage, and asylum that was under a diocese's supervision.</p>

  <figure>
    <figcaption>Below is our map in progress, showing our preliminary data from the 1870 almanac.  Each dot represents one Catholic institution in the US (though some dots are stacked atop one another in urban areas)&#8212;usually a church, school hospital, orphanage, asylum, et al.  The different colors are not a key; rather, they represent different dioceseses that contain the institutions.</figcaption>
